# Color-Sensing Pick-and-Place Robotic Arm

**Overview**

This repository contains the hardware and software design for a color-sensing robotic arm capable of picking and placing objects based on their color. 

**Hardware Components**

* Microcontroller: [ Arduino Nano]
* Motors: [Servo Motors MG995]
* Color Sensor: [TCS3200]
* IR Sensor
* Power Supply: [5V]
* Gripper Mechanism: [The gripper mechanism can be a simple two-finger design actuated
by servos, or a more complex design using pneumatic or electric actuators for greater force and precision..]

**Software Components**

* Programming Language: [Arduino IDE]

**Getting Started**

1. **Hardware Assembly:**
   * Follow the provided assembly instructions to assemble the robotic arm.
   * Connect all components according to the wiring diagram.

2. **Software Setup:**
   * Install the Arduino IDE.
   * Upload the provided code to the microcontroller.

3. **Calibration:**
   * Calibrate the color sensor to accurately detect the target colors.
   * Adjust the motor positions to ensure precise movement.

4. **Operation:**
   * Power on the robotic arm.
   * The arm will scan the environment for objects of the target color.
   * Once an object is detected, the arm will pick it up and place it in the designated location.

**Future Improvements**

* Implement more advanced color detection algorithms.
* Add object tracking capabilities.
* Improve the precision and speed of the arm's movements.
* Develop a user-friendly interface for controlling the arm.
